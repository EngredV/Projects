# Introduction to multimedia programming CISC 1600
This was my very first website written as my first project for the class. 
Attached you can find the following files:
- index.html
- aboutme.html
- vanegas-home.html
- vanegas-style.css
- active.css
- an image folder with images used on the website
<p>all written in HTML and CSS.</p>

## OBJECTIVE
The main goal of this project was to make a webpage that implements everything
learned in class and that also contains the labs done so far.

## INSTRUCTIONS
To view the website, you can download the zip file and click on index.html and 
the website should open in your web browser. This is the only file you need to
open since the rest of the files are information contained within the website 
itself.

## Status
Project is: Finished
