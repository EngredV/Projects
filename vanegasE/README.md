# Introduction to multimedia programming CISC 1600
This was my very first website written as my first project for the class. 
Attached you can find the following files:
- index.html
- aboutme.html
- vanegas-home.html
- vanegas-style.css
- active.css
- an image folder with images used on the website
<p>all written in HTML and CSS.</p>

## OBJECTIVE
The main goal of this project was to make a webpage that implements everything
learned in class and that also contains the labs done so far.

## Status
Project is: Finished
