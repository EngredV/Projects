# Starting Out With Java From Control Structures through Objects 7th Edition
by Tony Gaddis Textbook HW Problems
<br/>
These are two of my favorite HW questions that were assigned during CISC 3115.
Attached you can find the following files:
- GirlNames.txt
- BoyNames.txt
- Name_Search.java
- Question.java
- TriviaGame.java
<p>all written in the Java language.</p>

## OBJECTIVE
The main goal of these hw's were to practice what was learned in class. The files
GirlNames.txt, BoyNames.txt, and Name_Search.java all go together and are the code
for the section Programming Challenges from Chapter 7, Question 14. The question
is as follows:
Write a program that reads the contents of the two files (GirlNames.txt, BoyNames.txt)
into two separate arrays, or ArrayLists. The user should be able to enter a boy's 
name, a girl's name, or both, and the application will display messages indicating
whether the names were amongst the most popular.
<br/>
The files Question.java and TriviaGame.java go together and are the code for
the section Programming Challenges from Chapter 7, Question 19. The question is 
as follows:
In this programming challenge, you will create a simple trivia game for two players.
The program will work like this:
- Starting with player 1, each player gets a turn at answering 5 trivia questions.
(There are 10 questions, 5 for each player.) When a question is displayed, four 
possible answers are also displayes. Only one of the answers is correct, and if 
the player selects the correct answer, he or she earns a point.
-  After answers have been selected for all of the questions, the program displays 
the number of points earned by each player and declares the player with the highest
number of points the winner.
